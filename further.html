\NoteFF{NLTK says: ``Select one of the classification tasks described in this
  chapter, such as name gender detection, document classification,
  part-of-speech tagging, or dialog act classification. Using the same
  training and test data, and the same feature extractor, build three
  classifiers for the task: a decision tree, a naive Bayes classifier,
  and a Maximum Entropy classifier. Compare the performance of the
  three classifiers on your selected task. How do you think that your
  results might be different if you used a different feature
  extractor?'' Berkeley  maxent for proper noun classification, or POS
  tagging\protect{\url{http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~klein/cs288/}}}
