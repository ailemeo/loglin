  <p><b>Novel outcomes.</b> Now let's consider a case where our training
    set contains no squares.  What is the optimal weight for
    the <code>square</code> feature in this case, and why?</p>

  <p>Click "Solve."  What weight does the gradient ascent solver find
    for the <code>square</code> feature?  Is it what you predicted
    above?  Can you improve the log-likelihood at all by changing it to your
    prediction?</p>

  <p>The training set contained 500 events (tokens).  What
    probabilities are predicted for the three novel outcome types&mdash;solid
    square, striped square, hollow square?  Are these good estimates
    for novel outcomes?</p>

  <p><b>Regularization.</b>  Read about regularization in section 3 of the
    <A HREF="pdf/formulas.pdf">handout</A>.</p>

  <p>Open up <A HREF="#1" target="_blank">lesson 1</A> in
  a new window.  Use the radio buttons to experiment with
  &ell;<sub>1</sub> or &ell;<sub>2</sub> regularization.  When regularization
  is turned on, we are no longer trying to maximize the length of the
  entire log-likelihood bar, but only the gray part.  The red part
  corresponds to the regularizer that we subtract from the
  log-likelihood.</p>

  <p>If you click "Zero weights" or move the sliders away from 0, what
    happens to the size of the regularizer (the red part of the
    log-likelihood bar)?</p>

  <p>Experiment with changing the regularization coefficient <i>C</i>.
  How does this affect the size of the regularizer?  How does it
  affect the gradient hints?  What weights does "Solve" find
  if <i>C</i> is large?  Is the answer different for &ell;<sub>1</sub> and
  &ell;<sub>2</sub>?</p>

  <p><b>Regularization as smoothing.</b> Now come back here to lesson
  8.  Can you estimate more plausible probabilities for novel outcomes by
  running the solver with regularization?  Describe what you did and
  what happened.  Were the three novel outcomes estimated to have equal
  probabilities?  Explain.</p>
