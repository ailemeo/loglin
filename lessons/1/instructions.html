  <p>Welcome!  This interactive visualization will help you understand
  the popular technique of log-linear modeling.  For a quick intro
  with the simple defining formulas, consult the second half
  of <A HREF="http://cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/hw-prob/hw-prob.pdf">this
  homework</A>.</p>

<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>The sliders below control the parameters ("weights") of a log-linear model.
    When you increase the <i>circle</i> weight, which filled shapes get
    bigger?  Which ones get smaller?</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">

  <p>One game is to try to match all 4 shapes to the <i>gray outlines</i>.
    You will need to use both sliders.  A shape will turn gray if it
    matches well.  It turns red if it is too small, blue if it is too
    big.</p>

</div>

<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>Your model is defining a probability for each shape, shown by the
    area of the shape.  When the weights are 0, all 4 shapes are equally likely
    (probability 1/4).</p>

  <p>But the <i>empirical</i> probability of solid circles is 1/2, because
  30 of the 60 shapes in your <i>training data</i> are solid circles.
  This "target" of 1/2 is shown by the area outlined in gray.</p>

  <p>When your model says that <i>p</i>(solid circle) = 1/4, then it
    incorrectly expects only about 15 of 60
  shapes to be solid circles.  The <i>observed count</i> of 30 and the
  <i>expected count</i> of 15 are contrasted in the solid circle box.
  You are trying to make them match.  So fix your model by increasing
  the <i>circle</i> weight!</p>
