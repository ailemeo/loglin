  <p>Welcome!  This interactive visualization will help you understand
  the popular technique of log-linear modeling.</p>
</div>

<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p><b>Try it out:</b> The sliders below control the parameters ("weights") of a log-linear model.
    When you increase the <code>circle</code> weight, which filled shapes get
    bigger?  Which ones get smaller?</p>
</div>

<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">

  <p>One game is to try to match all 4 shapes to
    the <b><font color="gray">gray outlines</font></b>.  You will need
    to use both sliders.  A shape will
    turn <font color="gray">gray</font> if it matches well.  It turns
    <font color="red">red</font> if it is too
    small, <font color="blue">blue</font> if it is too
    big.  <i>Note:</i> You may like to zoom in with your browser.</p>

  <p><b>What the picture means:</b> Your model defines a probability
    for each shape.  You're adjusting these <i>model probabilities</i>
    by changing the weights.  When the weights are 0, all 4 shapes
    have equal probability of &frac14;, as shown by their equal areas.</p>

  <p>However, fully &frac12; of the shapes in your <i>training data</i>
    are solid circles.  You are trying to match this "target" of
    &frac12;: the <i>empirical probability</i> of solid circles.  It is shown by the larger area
    outlined in <b><font color="gray">gray</font></b>.
    (To compare the probabilities as decimal numbers rather than
    areas, point to the solid circle with your mouse.)</p>

  <p><b>Expected and observed counts:</b> There are <i>N</i>=60 shapes
    in your training data.  If your model says that <i>p</i>(solid
    circle) = &frac14;, it incorrectly predicts that &frac14;&middot;<i>N</i>
    = <font color="red">15</font> of the 60 training shapes should be
    solid circles.  By increasing the <code>circle</code> weight, you
    can improve your model until it predicts the actual observed count
    of &frac12;&middot;<i>N</i> = <b><font color="gray">30</font></b>.
    The <i>observed count</i> <b><font color="gray">30</font></b> and
    the current <i>expected count</i> <font color="red">15</font> are
    contrasted in the solid circle box.  They are proportional to the
    empirical and model probabilities.</p>

  <p><b>Activity 1: </b>What weights are needed to make the model
  approximately match the training data?  (All four shapes will match
  their outlines and turn gray, and their expected counts will equal
  their observed counts.)</p>

  Now read sections 1-2 of <A HREF="pdf/formulas.pdf" target="_blank">this handout</A>
  to understand exactly how the <code>circle</code> and <code>solid</code>
  sliders control the probability of the 4 events.  

  <p><b>Activity 2:</b> Use the sliders to try the following weight
    settings.  In each case, can you determine the exact probabilities of
    the four shapes, using the formula from section 2 of the handout?
    <ol type="a">
      <li><code>circle</code> = 1, <code>solid</code> = 1
      <li><code>circle</code> = 1, <code>solid</code> = -1
      <li><code>circle</code> = 1, <code>solid</code> = &infin;
      <li><code>circle</code> = 1, <code>solid</code> = -&infin;
      <li><code>circle</code> = &infin;, <code>solid</code> = -&infin;
    </ol>
    How could you make each solid shape be exactly twice as big as its
    striped counterpart?</p>

  way, note that you can stretch this text box to make it bigger.</p>
