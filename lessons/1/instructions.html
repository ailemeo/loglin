  <p>Welcome!  This interactive visualization will help you understand
  the popular technique of log-linear modeling.  For a quick intro
  to the simple defining formulas, consult the second half
  of <A HREF="http://cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/hw-prob/hw-prob.pdf">this
  homework handout</A>.</p>

  <p><b>Try it out:</b> The sliders below control the parameters ("weights") of a log-linear model.
    When you increase the <code>circle</code> weight, which filled shapes get
    bigger?  Which ones get smaller?</p>
</div>

<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">

  <p>One game is to try to match all 4 shapes to the <i>gray outlines</i>.
    You will need to use both sliders.  A shape will turn gray if it
    matches well.  It turns red if it is too small, blue if it is too
    big.  <i>Note:</i> You may like to zoom in with your browser.</p>

<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p><b>What the picture means:</b> Your model is defining a
    probability for each shape.  When the weights are 0, all 4 shapes
    have equal probability of 1/4.  This is shown by their equal
    areas.</p>

  <p>But the <i>empirical</i> probability of solid circles is 1/2, because
  30 of the 60 shapes in your <i>training data</i> are solid circles.
  This "target" of 1/2 is shown by the larger area outlined in gray.</p>

  <p>Since your model currently says that <i>p</i>(solid circle) =
    1/4, it incorrectly expects only about 15 of the 60 training
    shapes to be solid circles.  By increasing the <code>circle</code>
    weight, you can improve your model until it predicts the observed
    count of 30.  The <i>observed count</i> of 30 and the current
  <i>expected count</i> of 15 are contrasted in the solid circle box.</p>

  <p><b>Activity 1: </b>What weights are needed to approximately match
  the training data?  (All 4 shapes will match their outlines and turn
  gray, and their expected counts will equal their observed counts.)</p>

  <p><b>Activity 2:</b> Use the sliders to try the following weight
    settings.  In each case, can you determine the exact probabilities of
    the four shapes, using the log-linear formula when needed?
    <ol type="a">
      <li><code>circle</code> = 1, <code>solid</code> = 1
      <li><code>circle</code> = 1, <code>solid</code> = -1
      <li><code>circle</code> = 1, <code>solid</code> = &infin;
      <li><code>circle</code> = 1, <code>solid</code> = -&infin;
      <li><code>circle</code> = &infin;, <code>solid</code> = -&infin;
    </ol>
    How could you make each solid shape be exactly twice as big as its
    striped counterpart?</p>
