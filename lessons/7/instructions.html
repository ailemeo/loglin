  <p>Same model, new dataset.  The model is wrong in this case: the
  new dataset did not actually come from this 6-feature log-linear
  model.  Its 9 probabilities cannot be matched well by manipulating
  the 6 parameters of this model.</p>

  <p>So, just do the best you can with this model by following the
  gradient hints.</p>

  <p><b>Automatic parameter tuning.</b> As a convenience, you can
  click the "Step" button.  This moves all of the sliders slightly in
  the direction of their hints.  The "Step size" field (which you can
  change) controls how far they move.  However, a slider with a longer
  hint bar will always move farther than one with a shorter hint
  bar.</p>

  <p>As a further convenience, you can click the "Solve" button.  This
  clicks the "Step" button over and over for you until the
  log-likelihood is maximized.  You can watch the log-likelihood bar
  get longer and longer as the solver continues to follow the
  hints.</p>

  <p>(This is the method of <i>gradient ascent</i>.  Other automatic
  solution methods would also work, such as improving or optimizing
  one weight at a time.  Both methods require looping through all the
  weights repeatedly until all the hints are 0.)</p>

  <p><b>Dangers.</b> If the step size is too big, the solver could
  jump back and forth over the optimal weights without ever landing on
  them.  Taking too big a step can even make the log-likelihood worse.
  So our solver gradually reduces the step size as it goes, allowing
  it to zero in on the answer.  It jumps rapidly toward the right
  answer and then starts to fine-tune.
</p>

  <p>Occasionally the solver may stop too early.  You can try reducing
  the stepsize and clicking "Solve" again.</p>
