<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>Same model, new dataset.  This time you won't be able to match
  exactly.  The model is wrong: the new dataset did not actually come
  from this 6-feature log-linear model.  Its 9 probabilities cannot be
  matched well by manipulating the 6 parameters of this model.</p>

  <p>So, just do the best you can with this model by following the
  gradient hints.</p>

  <p>As a convenience, you can click the "Step" button.  This moves all
  of the sliders slightly in the direction of their hints.  The
  "Step size" field (which you can change) controls how far they move.
  However, a slider with a longer hint bar will always move farther
  than one with a shorter hint bar.</p>

  <p>As a further convenience, you can click the "Solve" button.  This
  clicks the "Step" button over and over for you until the
  log-likelihood is maximized.  This is the method of <i>gradient ascent</i>.</p>

  <p>If the step size is too big, the solver could jump back and
  forth over the maximum without ever landing on it.  So it gradually
  reduces the step size as it goes, allowing it to zero in on the
  maximum.</p>

  <p>Occasionally the solver may stop too early.  You can try reducing
  the stepsize and trying again.</p>
