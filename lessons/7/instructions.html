  <p>Same model, new dataset.  The model is <i>wrong</i> in this case: the
  new dataset was <i>not</i> actually sampled from a log-linear probability
  distribution with these 6 features.  So its 9 probabilities cannot
  be matched well by manipulating the 6 parameters of this model.</p>

  <p>So, just do the best you can with this model by following the
  gradient hints.</p>

  <p><b>Automatic parameter tuning.</b> As a convenience, you can
  click the "Step" button.  This moves all of the sliders slightly in
  the direction of their hints.  Note that the "Step" button controls
  the sliders more precisely than your mouse can.  The "Step size"
  field (which you can change) controls how far they move.  However, a
  slider with a longer hint bar will always move farther than one with
  a shorter hint bar.</p>

  <p>As a further convenience, you can click the "Solve" button.  This
  clicks the "Step" button over and over for you until the
  log-likelihood is maximized.  You can watch the log-likelihood bar
  get longer and longer as the solver continues to follow the
  hints.</p>

  <p>(This is the method of <i>gradient ascent</i>.  Other automatic
  solution methods would also work, such as <i>coordinate ascent</i>,
  which improves or optimizes one weight at a time.  Both these methods
  require looping through all the weights repeatedly until all the
  hints are 0.)</p>

  <p><b>Dangers.</b> Bigger steps can make faster progress, but steps
  that go <i>too</i> far can hurt progress.  (Overly large steps could
  jump back and forth over the optimal weights without ever landing on
  them.)  So our solver dynamically <i>adjusts</i> the step size to
  increase the log-likelihood about as rapidly as possible.</p>

  <p>The solver has to decide when to stop.  You could try clicking
  "Solve" again if you want further improvement.</p>

  <p><b>Questions.</b> Run the solver until there is no red or blue
  left on the sliders.  Now how well does the <i>total</i> expected
  number of circles match the number of circles observed in training
  data?  Why?</p>

  <p>However, there will still be red and blue left on some of the
  shapes.  How well do the expected counts for <i>individual</i> kinds
  of circles match the training data?  Why?</p>
