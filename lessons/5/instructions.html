<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>Until now, all of our features have been
    binary.  <i>f</i><sub>solid</sub>(<i>y</i>) returns 1 if <i>y</i>
    is filled with a solid color, and 0 otherwise.</p>

  <p>But below, we illustrate a feature whose value can be 3, 4, or 5.
    For example, <i>f</i><sub>number_of_sides</sub>(striped square) = 4.</p>

  <p>If this feature's weight is set to 1 (or -1), then what is the
    ratio of probabilities among the solid triangle, solid square, and
    solid pentagon?  Try it!  How does your answer change as you vary
    the weight of the <code>solid</code> feature?</p>
