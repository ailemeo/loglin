<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>Until now, all of our features have been
    binary.  <i>f</i><sub><code>solid</code></sub>(<i>y</i>) returns 1 if <i>y</i>
    is filled with a solid color, and 0 otherwise.</p>

  <p>But below, we illustrate a feature whose value can be 3, 4, or 5.
    For
    example, <i>f</i><sub><code>number_of_sides</code></sub>(striped
    square) = 4.</p>

  <p>Point to that feature's slider with your mouse.  As you see, the
    dataset has 420 sides altogether, so the average shape has 4.6 sides.
    But the initial model predicts that the average shape
    should have only 4 sides because it thinks that triangles, squares
    and pentagons are equally likely.</p>

  <p>If you change the feature's weight to 1 (or -1), then what is the
    ratio of model probabilities among the solid triangle, solid square, and
    solid pentagon?  Try it!  How does your answer change as you vary
    the weight of the <code>solid</code> feature?</p>
