<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>This is the same tricky dataset as last time.  But we've given
   you one more slider than before.  Now can you match all 4 shapes?</p>

 <p>Does the new slider only adjust <i>p</i>(striped triangle)?  Why
 or why not?</p>

 <p>What new feature could we have added instead of <i>triangle&amp;striped</i>?</p>
