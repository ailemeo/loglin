<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>This is the same tricky dataset as last time.  But we've given
   you one more slider than before.  <i>Now</i> can you match all 4
   shapes?  How?</p>

 <p>Does the new slider only adjust <i>p</i>(striped triangle)?  Why
 or why not?</p>

 <p>What other new feature could be used instead of <code>triangle &amp; striped</code>?</p>
