  <p>Try fitting the same model to the training dataset below.  This new
  dataset consists mostly of <i>solid circles</i> and <i>striped triangles</i>.
</div> 

<div id="p2"  class="showable_instructions">
  <p>Play the game of matching all 4 shapes at once.  Why are you
  unable to succeed this time?  Try to state a clear and concise
  reason.</p>
</div>

<div id="p3" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>Since this model can't predict these data perfectly, you'd better
    find a new game.  Here are two games to try:</p>

  <p><b>Log-likelihood game.</b>  Try to predict the data "as well as
  you can."  How big can you make the <i>log-likelihood</i> of
  your model (shown by the horizontal gray bar)?  This measures how
  well your model predicts the training data.</p>

  <p><b>Matching game.</b>  Even if you can't match all 4
  probabilities with your sliders, maybe you can match the 4 features.
  That is, try to make your model predict that among 60 shape tokens, you
  would have
  <ul>
    <li>40 <code>circle</code> shapes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(both solid and striped)
    <li>20 <code>triangle</code> shapes &nbsp;(both solid and striped)
    <li>40 <code>solid</code> shapes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(both circles and triangles)
    <li>20 <code>striped</code> shapes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(both circles and triangles)
  </ul>
  just as in the training data.
</div>

<div id="p4" class="showable_instructions">
  <p><b>Question.</b> These two games are actually related.  When you
  make a good move in the log-likelihood game, does it seem to help or hurt
  the matching game?  How about vice-versa?
