<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>We've added two more sliders to your control panel.</p>

  <p>What is the difference between increasing <code>circle</code> by 2 and
  decreasing <code>triangle</code> by 2?</p>

  <p>What happens if you increase both <code>circle</code>
  and <code>triangle</code> by the same amount?</p>

  <p>Does it help at all to have 4 sliders, or could you do just as
  well with 2 of them?  Which 2?</p>

  <p>To understand exactly what
    <li>the 4 sliders are doing, read the rest of 
    section 1 in the <A HREF="formulas.pdf"
    target="_blank">handout</A>.  Then continue with sections 2 and 3.</p>
