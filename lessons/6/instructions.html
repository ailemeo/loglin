  <p>Let's move up to a bigger example with 9 shape types.  Try matching
  the gray outlines now.  The better the match, the longer the
  log-likelihood bar should be.</p>

  <p><b>Getting hints.</b> In this larger problem, it's hard to decide which sliders to
    move.  So, let's get some automatic help!  Check the "Show
    gradients" checkbox.  Now each slider shows a hint about the best
    direction to move it.  For example, 
    <ul>
      <li>A short rightward (red) bar indicates that the
    log-likelihood will improve <i>slowly</i> as you <i>increase</i> that weight.
      <li>A long leftward (blue) bar indicates that the log-likelihood
    will improve <i>quickly</i> as you <i>decrease</i> that weight.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Try following the hints on the sliders to match the gray outlines.
  Easier?</p>

  <p>Drag the <code>triangle</code> slider back and forth to make its weight
    very big and very small.  As you do this, what happens to the hints on the 
  <code>circle</code> and <code>square</code> sliders?  Why?</p>
 
  <p><b>Understanding the hints.</b> Recall the two games from lesson
  3.  The hint on the slider can be interpreted as a hint
  for <i>either</i> game.

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Log-likelihood game.</b> Following the hint on the <code>circle</code> slider will increase
      the log-likelihood.  That's because the length of the hint bar is
      the partial derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to
      the <code>circle</code> weight.</p>

      <li><p><b>Matching game.</b> Following the same hint will also improve the match between
      the expected and observed number of circles.  That's because the
      length of the hint bar is (observed circles - expected circles).</p>
    </ul>

    <p>These two lengths are the same.
    The <A HREF="http://cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/hw-prob/hw-prob.pdf">homework
    handout</A> shows that the formula for the partial derivative
    is simply (observed - expected).</p> 

  <p>You may enjoy going back to previous lessons and playing with the
  gradient hints there, too.</p>
