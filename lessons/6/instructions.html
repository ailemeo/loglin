  <p>Let's move up to a bigger example with 9 shape types.  Try matching
  the gray outlines now.  The log-likelihood bar tells you how well you're
  matching them overall.</p>

  <p><b>Getting hints.</b> In this larger problem, it's hard to decide which sliders to
    move.  So, let's get some automatic help!  Check the "Show
    gradients" checkbox.  Now each slider shows a hint about the best
    direction to move it.  
    <ul>
      <li>Move the weight along the hint bar to improve the
	log-likelihood.  
      <li>The direction of the hint bar is also color-coded.  Red says to
	increase, blue says to decrease.
      <li>A long hint bar indicates that the log-likelihood is very
	sensitive to this weight.  You can increase the log-likelihood 
	<i>rapidly</i> by moving the slider in that direction.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Try following the hints on the sliders to match the gray outlines.
  Easier?</p>

  <p>Drag the <code>triangle</code> slider back and forth to make its weight
    very big and very small.  As you do this, what happens to the hint
    on the triangle slider?  What happens to the hints on the 
  <code>circle</code> and <code>square</code> sliders?  Why?</p>
 
  <p><b>Understanding the hints.</b> Recall the two games from
  lesson 3.  The hint on the slider can be interpreted as a hint
  for <i>either</i> game.

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Log-likelihood game.</b> Following the hint on
      the <code>circle</code> slider will increase the log-likelihood.
      That's because the length of the hint bar is the partial
      derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to
      the <code>circle</code> weight.</p>

      <li><p><b>Matching game.</b> Following the same hint will also
      improve the match between the expected and observed number of
      circles.  That's because the length of the hint bar is (observed
      circles - expected circles).</p>
    </ul>

    <p>These two lengths are the same.  The formula for the partial
    derivative is simply (observed - expected), as shown on the
 <A HREF="http://cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/hw-prob/hw-prob.pdf">homework
    handout</A>.</p> 

  <p>In fact, why not try lesson 3 again using the hints?  <i>Much</i> easier! </p>
