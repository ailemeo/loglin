  <p>This is exactly the same as setting as the <A HREF="#11">previous
    lesson</A>.  We're merely replacing the three languages by shapes.
    So now we're modeling the probability that a triangle would
    be <code>solid</code>, <code>striped</code>,
    or <code>hollow</code>: that is, p(<code>solid</code>
    | <code>triangle</code>), p(<code>striped</code>
    | <code>triangle</code>), p(<code>hollow</code>
    | <code>triangle</code>).  We will use this setup for the
    next several lessons.</p>

  <p>Unlike the joint model of <A HREF="#6">lesson 6</A>, the
  conditional model does <i>not</i> try to predict the probability of
  triangles.  The total expected number of triangles is fixed
  (at <i>N</i><sub><code>triangle</code></sub> = 15), a number that is
  taken directly from the training data.  The model only tries to
  predict the fill pattern <i>given</i> that it has a triangle.</p>
