  <p>This is identical to <A HREF="#12">lesson 12</A>, except that
    the model now has some new features corresponding to the contexts
    (<code>triangle</code>, <code>circle</code>, <code>pentagon</code>).  

  <p>What is the effect of adjusting these features' weights (with no
    regularization)?  If you increase
    &theta;<sub><code>triangle</code></sub>, what happens if you click
    "Step" or "Solve"?  How sensitive is the objective function to
    this weight (check "Show Gradients" to see)?  Explain what's going
    on, and why it's different from <A HREF="#6"
    target="_blank">lesson 6</A>.</p>
