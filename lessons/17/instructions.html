  If you make striped & circle really big, what happens to the four probabilities?  First ignore the gray outlines.  What are the probabilities and expected counts (given N) when all features are 0?  If the total score of one object is 1 or 2 more than the total score of another object, what happens to their relative probabilities?  (for example, set circle to 1 and striped to 1.  What are the relative probabilities of the 4 objects?)  What happens to the probabilities when circle goes to +infinity?  to -infinity?  What happens to the log likelihood in these cases and why?  Now try to match the gray outlines, which represent the counts you’re trying to match.  If circles overall have too low a count, you should increase circle slider: the tooltip on the slider adds up the expected and observed counts for you.  Show them the “new random challenge button.”
