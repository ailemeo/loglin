  <p>Here's a little application of log-linear modeling to text
  categorization.  Each natural-language phrase is classified as to
  whether it is spam.</p>

  <p>Your job is to poke around and figure out what is going on here.
  Remember, we must be modeling some conditional probability
  distribution p(outcome | context).</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>What are the <i>contexts</i>?  Why do most (but not all) contexts have count 1?
    <li>What are the possible <i>outcomes</i>?  How are they displayed as shapes?
    <li>What kind of information below indicates that a
      particular <i>training</i> phrase has been labeled as spam?  
    <li>Which are the two <i>test</i> phrases included below?  How do you know?
    <li>If you train this model without regularization, what happens
    to the log-likelihood and the weights?  Why?
    <li>If you train this model with regularization, how does it
      classify the two test phrases?  Look at the weights: what features helped it make
      this classification?
    <li>You might think that <code>'fortune'</code> fires on any
      phrase that contains the word <code>'fortune'</code>.  But
      <A HREF="#14" target="_blank">lesson 14</A> suggests that can't
      quite work.  Let's be precise: what (context,outcome) pairs
      is <code>'fortune'</code> really defined to fire on?
    <li><code>mentions money</code> is a binary feature.  What are
      some words that cause it to fire?  How did you find out?
    <li>Is the feature <code>'yada'</code> a binary feature, or a counting feature?
      That is, does <i>f</i><sub>yada</sub> return 1 or 3 on <code>yada yada yada</code>?
      How did you find out?
    <li>Which of the non-spam messages does your trained model think is
      spammiest?  How do you know?
    <li>This is an example of <i>binary classification</i>, since there
      are just two possible decisions.  How would you extend the
      approach to do three-way classification of a phrase as {spam,work,fun}?
