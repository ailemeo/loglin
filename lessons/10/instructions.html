<div id="p1" class="showable_instructions">
  <p>Here are the same <i>N</i> = 5 data, but modeled with a different
  feature for each shape.  Again try solving with &ell;<sub>2</sub>
  regularization and <i>C</i> = 1.  What do you notice about the
  expected counts of the five novel outcomes?</p>

  <p>Now increase <i>N</i> to 5000 and click "Solve" again.  What
  happens to the novel outcomes?  What happens to the weights?</p>

  <p>Discuss how these behaviors differ from what you saw in the
    <A HREF="#9" target="_blank">previous lesson</A>, and why.</p>
