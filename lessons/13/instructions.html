  <p>This example shows one way that maximizing conditional likelihood is
    different from maximizing joint likelihood.</p>

  <p>In the English (square) context, it is now <i>only</i> possible
    to talk about <code>solid</code>.  As a result, there
    are <i>lots</i> of solid shapes in our training data.  Yet
    what are the weights that maxmize the conditional log-likelihood?
    Discuss why this is.</p>
